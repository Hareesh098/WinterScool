    <h2>Directions</h2>
     <p>
     The school will take place at the Lopatie Conference Centre at the Weizmann Institute of Science campus 
     in Rehovot, Israel. The Weizmann Institute is located at a city named Rehovot. Rehovot is located in the 
     center of the country. It has a population of over 130,000 and is located between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, 
     about 15 mins drive from the beach and about 30 mins drive from the International Airport. The city has 
     (by Israeli standards) a large English-speaking population. To know more about the city and life at Rehovot

     </p>

     <h5>By Taxi</h5>
     <p> 
     Take a taxi from Ben-Gurion Airport’s taxi dispatcher station. The cost should be around NIS 160 
     (approximately $40 U.S. dollars), and the ride should take around 30-40 minutes. If the taxi driver
     does not understand your accent tell him to take you to the "Makhon Weizmann".
     </p>
     
     <h5>By Bus</h5>
     
     <p>
     If you are traveling light, bus #249 travels to Rehovot's central bus station from the airport. This is 
     not, however, an express bus and the drive will take approximately 1:15 hours. The cost is about US $3.00. 
     Once at Rehovot's central bus station, there are a multitude of local buses which go to the Weizmann 
     Institute (ask at the information window), or you can take a taxi from the taxi stand directly across 
     the street from the bus station.
     </p>
     
     <h5>By Train</h5>
     <p>
     You can also get to the Weizmann Institute by taking the train from the airport. Change at the Tel Aviv 
     Hagana stop for the train to Rehovot. The train station in Rehovot is about a 5-minute walk from the 
     Weizmann Institute.
